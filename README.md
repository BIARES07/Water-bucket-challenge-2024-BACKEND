# Water Bucket Challange

 Welcome to my project!

Below, I will explain in detail how it works and how to configure it correctly.

This project is based on an exercise where you will design a solution for the classic Water Jug Riddle. The objective is to create an API that calculates the steps needed to measure exactly Z gallons of water using two jugs with capacities of X and Y gallons.

The project is organized into three folders:

- testing-integration: This folder contains integration tests, which verify how different parts of the application handle requests and work together.
- Unit-Test-Jug: This folder contains unit tests that specifically check the effectiveness of the core algorithm.
- Water-Jug-Challenge: This folder also contains the main code for the algorithm, and we'll be taking a closer look at this folder shortly.
